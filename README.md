# ChessEngine
The aim of this project is to create a chess engine using python. 

A chess engine is defined as 'a computer program that analyzes chess or chess variant positions, and generates a move or list of moves that it regards as strongest'.

This project was inspired by the Chess-World project. The code for setting up the webapp using flask has been reused from that project. You can access that project [here](https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Chess-World)

### RandomMove

The first engine that was produced is one that simply plays a random legal move.
